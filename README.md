## WattBox WB-800 custom component for Home Assistant

### Install

- Copy the `custom_components/wb800` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components` directory.
- Restart Home Assistant.

### Configure (YAML)

Add to `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
switch:
  - platform: wb800
    host: YOUR-WATTBOX-HOST
    username: YOUR-USERNAME
    password: YOUR-PASSWORD
    verify_ssl: false
    scan_interval: 30
```

Notes:
- Set `verify_ssl: false` if the device uses a self-signed certificate. The integration also supports `http://` base URLs.
- Each outlet will appear as an individual switch using the names from the device.

### Entities

- One `switch` per outlet, named from the WattBox UI.
- Attributes: `outlet_number`, `reset_only`, `watts`, `amps` (when available).

### Services

- Turn on/off via standard switch services in Home Assistant.

### Troubleshooting

- Ensure the WB-800 is reachable from Home Assistant and that the credentials are correct.
- If your unit requires HTTP Basic Auth, it will be detected automatically. If it requires form login, the component will perform it transparently.
